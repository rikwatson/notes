*Outside Context Problem (O.C.P.)*
>>>An outside context problem is a situation where one society (or civilisation) comes into contact with another which is superior in terms of technological development (Most commonly weaponry and transportation). Usually this results in the subjugation or destruction of the technologically inferior society.

The novelist Iain Banks ‘coined’ the phrase and used the idea as the central premise in his novel ‘Excession’. He described an O.C.P. “as the kind of problem most civilizations would encounter just once, and which they tended to encounter rather in the same way a sentence encountered a full stop."

‘The usual example given to illustrate an Outside Context Problem was imagining you were a tribe on a largish, fertile island; you'd tamed the land, invented the wheel or writing or whatever, the neighbors were cooperative or enslaved but at any rate peaceful and you were busy raising temples to yourself with all the excess productive capacity you had, you were in a position of near-absolute power and control which your hallowed ancestors could hardly have dreamed of and the whole situation was just running along nicely like a canoe on wet grass... when suddenly this bristling lump of iron appears sailless and trailing steam in the bay and these guys carrying long funny-looking sticks come ashore and announce you've just been discovered, you're all subjects of the Emperor now, he's keen on presents called tax and these bright-eyed holy men would like a word with your priests.’ – from Excession by I.M.Banks

# Outside Context Problem (O.C.P.)

An outside context problem is a situation where one society (or civilisation) comes into contact with another which is superior in terms of technological development (Most commonly weaponry and transportation).

 * Follow the blood Aroyo, to the place where the snake lays its eggs.
 * These violent delights have violent ends.
 * The problem with what you and I do is that it's so complicated. We practice witchcraft, we speak the right words, and we create life itself, out of chaos. William of Occam was a 13th century monk, he can't help us now, Bernard.  
   He would have us burned at the stake.
 * The maze is not for you.


 The purpose of writing is not to store facts for later. Well, it can be, if you’re writing down an address or phone number. But the purpose of writing down ideas is to document a thought process. When you go back and read what you wrote before, you are transported back to that experience of thought. You are able to pick up where you left off, and continue whatever journey you had embarked upon.
