# I Like Cars

I like cars; As an engineer I feel I must.

Some cars I like include:

* McLaren F1 - if this isn't your favourite car then you are dead to me
* Porsche 911 - if ever you needed proof of evolution then look no further.  
  Darwin would have been proud
* Smart Coupe Roadster - small time fun
* Lotus Elise / Vauxhall VX220 - separated at birth
* Honda NSX - a wake-up call to all performance car manufacturers,  
  I mean even the key is made of Monel.
* Tesla - the future - if we like it or not
* Honda Civic 1342cc - probably the best engine ever
* Fiat 500 - if you live in a city without hills
* Fiat Abarth - if you live in a city with hills
* Dino 246 - beauty
* Ferrari 288 GTO - every car list must feature a Ferrari by law
* Mercedes C111 - taxi firm does engineering
