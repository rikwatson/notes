# C Sharp Scripting

Two new extra feature worth mentioning, and these are new compiler directive, `#load` and `#r`. They are only allowed to be used in C# script code (would not work with "classic" C# syntax), and allow you to reference a script from another script (`#load`) and import an assembly reference from GAC or from a path (`#r`).
